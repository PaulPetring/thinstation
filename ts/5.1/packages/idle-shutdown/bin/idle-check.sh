# SHUTDOWN_IDLE_INTERVAL - every SHUTDOWN_IDLE_INTERVAL minutes 
# the current idle time will be checked via crontab. Default value
# is every 5 minutes
#
# SHUTDOWN_IDLE_TIME - how long is the thinstation allowed to idle.
# default value is 1800 seconds
#
# SHUTDOWN_PROGRAM - which program to check for. having that program
# running will reset the idle counter, default value is wfica
